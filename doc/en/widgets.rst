Available Widgets
=================

Compass
=======

The Compass widget belongs to the "single instant measure" category. It displays the latest value for a particular
Property expressing a direction or angle. The widget will periodically interrogate the server to get the latest value.

Mandatory inputs are:

* "service", "offering", "feature" and "property": selects a particular property to be shown. Property should take values between 0 and 360 (unit of measure is supposed to be degrees).
* "refresh_interval" (in seconds): is the time between updates (launches successive getObservations every Nth second).

Other optional inputs:

* "title": If not specified, defaults to the name of the Feature.
* "footnote": Optional small text caption at the bottom.
* "custom_css_url": css stylesheet to be applied to the widget.


Gauge
=====

Another "single instant measure", but for percentage values ranging 0 to 100.

Mandatory inputs are:

* "service", "offering", "feature" and "property": selects a particular property to be shown. Property should take values between 0 and 100 (unit of measure is supposed to be %).
* "refresh_interval" (in seconds): is the time between updates (launches successive getObservations every Nth second).

Other optional inputs:

* "footnote": Optional small text caption at the bottom.
* "custom_css_url": css stylesheet to be applied to the widget.


Jqgrid
======

It displays a `jqGrid table <http://www.trirand.com/blog/>`_, with a collection of observations for a given period of
time, each row being an observation. Results are paginated and can be sorted by any column value (Result time, Feature
name, Property Name, Value and Unit of Measure).

Mandatory inputs:

* "service", "offering", a collection of "features" and a collection of "properties": selects a collection of feature-property combinations to be shown.
* "time_start" and "time_end": The result time range of the observations to be displayed.
* "title": the widget title.

Other optional inputs:

* "footnote": Optional small text caption at the bottom.
* "custom_css_url": css stylesheet to be applied to the widget. Please note that jqGrid look & feel is taken from the underlying jQuery-ui theme.

.. note:: this widget depends on jQuery, jQuery UI and the jgGrid plugin itself. It's a rather heavy and not much
   customizable (it was made as an integration exercise with a legacy application). We recommend the use of other
   widgets such as the "table" one, which is more in the spirit of Sensor Widgets: lightweight, compact and easily
   customizable.


Map
===

This widget is special in many senses. First off, it represents a GetFeatureOfInterest response, instead of the most
usual GetObservation response.

Sencondly, it is a highly customizable widget, with a lot of configuration options. Fortunately most of the inputs are
optional, so its basic usage is in fact very simple.

It is built on the `Leaflet <http://leafletjs.com/>`_ mapping library.

The only strictly mandatory parameters are:

* "service" and "offering": Determines the offering whose Features of Interest are to be displayed on a map.

This will display a map with the Features on it. Placing the mouse pointer over the map features will display a little
tooltip with the feature name.

.. figure:: ../img/map-no-features-no-properties.png
   :align: center

   Simple map with no features and no properties indicated.

There are another couple of mandatory (but not so mandatory) inputs:

* "features": One can select which features to display. If none is selected, *all* of the possible features are displayed (no filtering aplied). But you *have* to explicitly indicate an empty array of features as input.
* "properties": If one or more properties are selected, each feature's tooltip will be an embedded panel widget, displaying the list of properties. Again, you can indicate an empty array of properties. In this case, no property values are shown.

.. figure:: ../img/map-some-features-some-properties.png
   :align: center

   Simple map with four features and one property selected.

The "permanent_tooltips" optional parameter, if set to "true", will force the tooltips to be always shown, not only on
mouse hover.

.. figure:: ../img/map-permanent-tooltips.png
   :align: center

   Map with permanent tooltips.

If map elements appear located in the opposite side of the world, you probably have to change the coordinate axis order.
Setting the optional parameter "swap_axis"=true, latitude and longitude will be switched, and this effect will be fixed.

Besides the tooltip, we can also attach a sub-widget to each feature, which will be displayed when clicking the feature.
The "popup_widget" input is a JSON structure which contains a Widget definition. The "service", "offering" and
"feature(s)" inputs for the widget are taken from the *parent* map widget, so are not needed. The "name" property
indicates which widget to be instantiated.

For instance, if we want to open a popup containing a "timechart" on each feature click, we have to indicate:

   * "name": "timechart",
   * ...all the timechart widget inputs, except for "service" and "offering".

That is::

   {
       "name": "timechart",
       "title": "Temperatures",
       "properties": [
           "http://sensors.portdebarcelona.cat/def/weather/properties#32M",
           "http://sensors.portdebarcelona.cat/def/weather/properties#32",
           "http://sensors.portdebarcelona.cat/def/weather/properties#32N"
       ],
       "time_start": "2015-09-03T05:05:40Z",
       "time_end": "2015-09-03T08:05:40Z"
   }

.. figure:: ../img/map-with-custom-popup.png
   :align: center

   Map with a "compass" popup.

Apart from customizing both tooltips and popups with details about each feature, we can indicate a custom base layer
for the map, via the "base_layer" input. Two layer types can be specified:

* A Tile layer: Specify an "url", and a collection of "options". For example::

   {
      "url": "http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
      "options": {
	     "maxZoom": 19,
	     "attribution": "&copy; <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright'>OpenStreetMap contributors</a>"
	  }
   }

The "url" and "options" parameters correspond to `Leaflet's TileLayer <http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#tilelayer>`_
"urlTemplate" and "TileLayer_options" respectively.

There's a good collection of free tile layers here: http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/

* A WMS layer: Specify "type": "wms", an "url" and a collection of "options". For example::

   {
      "type": "wms",
      "url": "http://geoserveis.icc.cat/icc_mapesbase/wms/service",
      "options": {
         "layers": "orto5m",
         "format": "image/jpeg",
         "attribution": "Ortofoto 1:5.000: CC-by <a href='http://www.icc.cat' target='_blank'>Institut Cartogr√†fic de Catalunya</a>"
      }
   }

.. figure:: ../img/map-custom-base-layer.png
   :align: center

   Map with a custom base WMS layer.

The "url" and "options" parameters correspond to `Leaflet's TileLayer.WMS <http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#tilelayer-wms>`_
"baseUrl" and "TileLayer.WMS_options" respectively.

Another optional input is "max_initial_zoom": It indicates the maximum zoom level to use when the map is
first rendered. This avoids to zoom in too much, so we loose context, especially when a single point feature is drawn.

Finally, the common "footnote" and  "custom_css_url" inputs are also available.

Panel
=====

The "panel" widget is used to display all (or some of) the last property values for a particular Feature. It is built
as an HTML Definition List, compatible with Bootstrap CSS classes. The widget will auto-refresh periodically.

Its mandatory inputs are:

* The usual "service", "offering" and "feature".
* A list of "properties" to be displayed.
* The "refresh_interval", in seconds.
* The Panel's "title".

And the usual optional inputs: "footnote" and "custom_css_url".

The panel will show the result time as a subtitle. In case some of the propertie's result time is previous to the common
one, the value will be displayed in red and the particular result time for that observation displayed explicitly.

.. figure:: ../img/panel.png
   :align: center

   Three Panel widgets, some of them showing outdated values.


Progressbar
===========

Another instant measure widget, this time displayed as a proportion bar between two values. It is useful to show how
a value relates to its boundary values. It can be used to display a percentage if min/max values ranging from 0 to 100,
but it could also be used to display a liquid level, or a pressure. Sort of a "gauge" but displayed linearly and with
custom value range.

Its mandatory inputs:

* The usual "service", "offering", "feature" and "property".
* "min_value" and "max_value", which will determine the extreme values.
* "refresh_interval" in seconds.

And the usual optional inputs: "footnote" and "custom_css_url".


Status
======

The "status" widget displays the whole offering status at a glance. Given an offering, it builds a table with all the
possible feature-property combinations, and for each one, the last observed value and its recency. It is a good way to
see the offering's health: If new data is being generated and for which sensors.

This widget is meant as a monitoring tool (sort of hypertable), and it's better displayed at full screen.

Its only mandatory inputs are "service" and "offering".

And the common optional inputs: "footnote" and "custom_css_url".


Table
=====

Given a feature and a time range, the table displays property values over a time period. It provides a more
compact view than jqGrid widget. The widget is built as a plain HTML table supporting Bootstrap's styling.

* The usual "service", "offering" and "feature".
* A list of "properties" to be displayed.
* "time_start" and "time_end": The result time range of the observations to be displayed.
* The table's "title".

And the common optional inputs: "footnote" and "custom_css_url".


Thermometer
===========

Another "single instant measure" widget, such as Compass or Gauge, but for atmospheric temperature in Celsius degrees.
It displays a thermometre drawing, whose values range from -24¬∫C to 56¬∫C. Numeric value is also shown. As other widgets
in its category, it has built in auto-refresh mechanism.

Mandatory inputs are:

* "service", "offering", "feature" and "property": selects a particular property to be shown. Unit of measure is supposed to be degrees celsius.
* "refresh_interval" (in seconds): is the time between updates.

Other optional inputs:

* "footnote": Optional small text caption at the bottom.
* "custom_css_url": css stylesheet to be applied to the widget.


Timechart
=========

Given a feature and a time range, it displays property values over a time period. Its interface is the same as the
"table" widget, but the results are displayed graphically on a chart.

Charts are built with the `Flot charting library <http://www.flotcharts.org/>`_, which in turn depends on jQuery.

* The usual "service", "offering" and "feature".
* A list of "properties" to be displayed.
* "time_start" and "time_end": Determines the time period of the observations to be displayed.
* The timechart's "title".

And the common optional inputs: "footnote" and "custom_css_url".

Windrose
========

This is a very specific widget, used to display wind regime statistics, where one can see at a glance the proportions
 of wind direction and wind speed over a period of time, for a particular location.

.. note:: The polar chart is built with the `Highcharts <http://www.highcharts.com/>`_ library. This library is free for
   non-commercial uses, but **a license must be purchased for commercial uses**.

Mandatory inputs are:

* "service", "offering", "feature": selects a particular location, which should offer both wind direction and wind speed properties.
* "properties": two and only two properties. One will be wind speed, in ``m/s``, and the other wind direction in ``deg``. Result times for both properties should be synchronized and obtained in regular time intervals.
* "time_start" and "time_end": the data time range to be gathered from SOS service.
* "refresh_interval" (in seconds): is the time between updates. As the windrose displays statistcs over a large dataset whose retrieval is expensive, it is recommended that the refresh interval is set to a high value (several minutes).
* "title" the widget's title.

Optional inputs:

* "subtitle".
* "footnote" and "custom_css_url".

This is how data is grouped to build the windrose chart:

a) The wind direction observations are grouped into 16 sectors: N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW and N.
b) For each sector, the corresponding wind speeds are classified in ranges: 0-2 m/s, 2-4 m/s, 4-6 m/s, 6-8 m/s , 8-10 m/s and > 10 m/s.

A polar chart with 16 distinct columns is drawn, each column containing different colored sectors, proportional to the wind speed counting.

.. note:: Unlike other widgets, which are meant to be lightweight and flexible, this one requires the SOS service to deliver the
   data in a very specific way. Moreover, it depends on a not completely free charting library. But the results for the
   specific use case it covers are very good. So, take this one example not as a generic, reusable widget, but as an example
   of *specialization*. And please, feel free to code your own widgets that better express your own data. See the next chapter,
   on how to contribute.
